### Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need Python (Version 3.8) and Pytest for Unit Tests:

* [Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Pytest Installation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/getting-started.html#install-pytest)

### Building program

306radiator is a B-MAT-500 EPITECH module project.

306radiator is about the heat coming out of a radiator.

You can use this program as it follows:

```textmate
$> ./306radiator --help
USAGE
    ./306radiator n ir jr [i j]

DESCRIPTION
    n           size of the room
    (ir, jr)    coordinates of the radiator
    (i, j)      coordinates of a point in the room
```

You can also launch unit tests by using the command below at root of the repository:

```textmate
$> coverage run --rcfile=.coveragerc -m --source=sources/ pytest --capture=sys -rA tests/

### Coding Style

306radiator is developed with Python. EPITECH doesn't impose any Coding Style to this but I tried to be as cleaner as possible.
